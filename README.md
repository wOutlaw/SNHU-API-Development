# API-Development

Repo showcasing my work in developing a REST API using Python. In this course I implemented a REST API using a Python web service framework
for a MongoDB collection of stock market summary data. The API allows Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. Bonus features include finding stocks with a 50 day moving average between two user specified values, displaying stocks by industry, and creating a list of the top five performing stocks in an industry.
